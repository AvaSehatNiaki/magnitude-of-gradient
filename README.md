# magnitude-of-gradient
Image Processing

Obtain the magnitude of gradient of the checkboard image using Sobel kernels.

the gradient filter in Matlab returns both vertical and horizontal components of an image.
Therefore when this function is called, both the sobel kernel and inverted kernel are applied 
to the image.The picture on the right present the orientation in which the filter was applied.
